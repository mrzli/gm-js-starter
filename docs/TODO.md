- refactoring:
  - allow hasTest option
    - create test folder
    - create test/automatic-tests folder
    - create example in automatic tests
    - create test/tsconfig.json, it should just extend main tsconfig.json and have separate include folders ('automatic-tests', 'manual-tests')
    - create test/jest.config.js
      - make sure to point to the correct tsconfig: https://huafu.github.io/ts-jest/user/config/tsConfig
    - include ts-jest and @types/jest in package.json
    - create test and test:ci scripts in package.json
      - need to point to the configuration (probably --config)
    - ignore test/tsconfig.json and test/jest.config.js in prettier
    - ignore test/jest.config.js in eslint
    - add project entry in eslint for 'test/tsconfig.json'
  - allow hasScripts option
    - create scripts folder
    - create scripts/src folder
    - have completely separate scripts/tsconfig.json
      - same as library configuration, but will omit 'output' part since it is not needed
    - create an example script
      - in scripts/src
      - just print out 'This is a script!'
    - add script to package.json
      - call it example-script
      - make sure to call it correctly
        - ts-node --project scripts/tsconfig.json scripts/src/postinstall.ts
    - ignore scripts/tsconfig.json in prettier
    - add project entry in eslint for 'scripts/tsconfig.json'
  
- automatic tests for generation:
  - find out how to list all files in the directory, recursively +
    - use that to test that all the required files were generated, and only the required files
  - have files with expected results, then compare actual to those file (read the files as strings into test)
  - later on see that this works on ci

- options:
  - generate monorepo root
  - generate library
  - generate frontend
  - generate backend

- base implementation:
  - ci
    - implement workflow (in .github under base folder)
  - other
    - README
  
- frontend:
  - later on setup tests:
    - generate new cra
    - see src/App.test.tsx and setupTests.ts
  - public folder:
    - favicons
      - https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
        - g / Rounded / Roboto / 110 / #FFFFFF / #00AAAA
    - manifest.json
      - need to input project name and display project name
    - robots.txt
      - just use from cra
    - index.html
      - adjust to take into account icons (or rename icons to fit here)
      - set title: display project name
  - src folder:
    - no tests for now
    - index.css
      - rename to 'index.scss' and use verbatim
    - reportWebVitals.ts
      - rename to 'report-web-vitals.ts'
      - use the one from dance site (generate it)
    - react-app-env.d.ts
      - copy verbatim
    - index.ts
      - will need more work
      - see dance site, or other projects
    - .gitignore
      - /.idea/, /build/, /node_modules/
    - package.json
      - look into more details
    - tsconfig.json
      - use default from library, then apply the changes
    - 'components' folder here
      - App.tsx
        - simple component returning display project name in div
        - component function should have a return value
        - should export component explicitly
